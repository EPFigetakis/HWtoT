data/cropped\001c_line_01.png,Predominantly sensors are accumulating data in a constant
data/cropped\001c_line_02.png,manner which can create large data sets that can be difficult
data/cropped\001c_line_03.png,to send due to several reasons such as limited
data/cropped\001c_line_04.png,computational power and bandwidth limitations A solution
data/cropped\001c_line_05.png,to this includes using compression algorithms to store
data/cropped\001c_line_06.png,important characteristics of data while reducing storage
data/cropped\001c_line_07.png,space However this method can be demanding when
data/cropped\001c_line_08.png,dealing with a drone that has limited amount of
data/cropped\001c_line_09.png,computation power and limited energy supply from
data/cropped\001c_line_10.png,a battery
data/cropped\001c_line_12.png,Dispatching data from a drone to a centralized
data/cropped\001c_line_13.png,system for storage and processing can cause
data/cropped\001c_line_14.png,latency and increase traffic if multiple
data/cropped\001c_line_15.png,sensors sending data Edge computing can prevent
data/cropped\001c_line_16.png,these issues by allowing computation to
data/cropped\001c_line_17.png,be closer to the network edge and data
data/cropped\001c_line_18.png,sources The use of an edge node to
data/cropped\001c_line_19.png,transfer data and run computational
data/cropped\001c_line_20.png,algorithms allows for collision avoidance
data/cropped\001c_line_21.png,of multiple drones allowing them to be
data/cropped\001c_line_22.png,in operation at the same time and return results
data/cropped\001c_line_23.png,in real time
data/cropped\001c_line_25.png,Focusing on the unmanned aerial vehicle the
data/cropped\001c_line_26.png,collision avoidance problem itself can be formulated
data/cropped\001c_line_27.png,in two ways as a path planning problem or as a
data/cropped\001c_line_28.png,collision avoidance maneuvering problem In the first
data/cropped\001c_line_29.png,case the problem is to plan a feasible path between
data/cropped\001c_line_30.png,two points while avoiding obstacles while the
data/cropped\001c_line_31.png,latter addresses the issue of performing avoidance
data/cropped\001c_line_32.png,maneuvers as obstacles are detected
data/cropped\002c_line_01.png,Due to an increase in mobile connected devices such
data/cropped\002c_line_02.png,as smartphones mobile sensors and automobiles the demand
data/cropped\002c_line_03.png,for a faster and more dependable network is increasing
data/cropped\002c_line_04.png,Several iterations of mobile networks have been introduced
data/cropped\002c_line_05.png,starting with first generation mobile networks since then
data/cropped\002c_line_06.png,many improvements have been made
data/cropped\002c_line_08.png,In semantic oriented communication the primary emphasis lies
data/cropped\002c_line_09.png,on the semantic content of the source data rather than the absolute
data/cropped\002c_line_10.png,accuracy of transmitted bits This approach involves the
data/cropped\002c_line_11.png,use of a semantic representation module tasked with capturing
data/cropped\002c_line_12.png,the semantic content from the source data while filtering
data/cropped\002c_line_13.png,out any superfluous or redundant information before the
data/cropped\002c_line_14.png,standard data encoding process for transmission Upon
data/cropped\002c_line_15.png,reception semantic inference and semantic decoding are
data/cropped\002c_line_16.png,employed to decode the transmitted data typically
data/cropped\002c_line_17.png,with the assistance of potent AI driven tools
data/cropped\002c_line_18.png,such as Neural Networks This process results in data
data/cropped\002c_line_19.png,compression and reduction thereby enhancing transmission
data/cropped\002c_line_20.png,accuracy and efficiency
data/cropped\002c_line_22.png,To build an efficient system a model must
data/cropped\002c_line_23.png,be trained to be able to extract information
data/cropped\002c_line_24.png,from an image and store it in a smaller
data/cropped\002c_line_25.png,file This part of the system is classified
data/cropped\002c_line_26.png,as the encoder for the system to work
data/cropped\002c_line_27.png,a decoder must be paired with it
data/cropped\002c_line_28.png,The decoder will be able to make sense
data/cropped\002c_line_29.png,of the features that have been encoded
data/cropped\002c_line_30.png,and sent By using this method we
data/cropped\002c_line_31.png,can reaffirm that the features will not be
data/cropped\002c_line_32.png,misinterpreted and differ from the class
data/cropped\003c_line_01.png,A custom framework was created using only numpy as
data/cropped\003c_line_02.png,an external library this was done so that only
data/cropped\003c_line_03.png,the necessary components of the program would be
data/cropped\003c_line_04.png,included greatly reducing bloat from importing external
data/cropped\003c_line_05.png,libraries It also guarantees compatibility between
data/cropped\003c_line_06.png,the model and the SOMs
data/cropped\003c_line_07.png,The Eastern Orthodox Church acknowledges the
data/cropped\003c_line_08.png,primacy of honor for the Bishop of Rome but not
data/cropped\003c_line_09.png,the doctrine of papal supremacy as defined by the
data/cropped\003c_line_10.png,Catholic Church Orthodox Christians believe that the
data/cropped\003c_line_11.png,Bishop of Rome was once seen as the first among
data/cropped\003c_line_12.png,equals but not as a supreme ruler with authority over
data/cropped\003c_line_13.png,the entire Church The Catholic Church asserts that the
data/cropped\003c_line_14.png,Pope as successor of Peter holds supreme authority in
data/cropped\003c_line_15.png,the Church and has the power to make binding decisions
data/cropped\003c_line_16.png,for the entire Church Orthodox Christians argue that the
data/cropped\003c_line_17.png,concept of papal supremacy developed later in the
data/cropped\003c_line_18.png,West and was not part of the early Church's understanding
data/cropped\003c_line_19.png,of papal authority
data/cropped\003c_line_21.png,Orthodox Christianity is experiencing growth in absolute
data/cropped\003c_line_22.png,numbers particularly in Russia and the United States but
data/cropped\003c_line_23.png,its share of the global Christian population and the
data/cropped\003c_line_24.png,global population overall is declining After the fall
data/cropped\003c_line_25.png,of the Soviet Union the Orthodox Church has seen
data/cropped\003c_line_26.png,a sharp resurgence in Russia with the Orthodox
data/cropped\003c_line_27.png,Christian population surpassing million Orthodoxy has
data/cropped\003c_line_28.png,historically grown through adapting its liturgies and
data/cropped\003c_line_29.png,languages to local cultures
