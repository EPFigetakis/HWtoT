cropped/003c_line_01.png,A custom framework was created using only numpy as
cropped/003c_line_02.png,an external library this was done so that only
cropped/003c_line_03.png,the necessary components of the program would be
cropped/003c_line_04.png,included greatly reducing bloat from importing external
cropped/003c_line_05.png,libraries It also guarantees compatibility between
cropped/003c_line_06.png,the model and the SOMs
cropped/003c_line_07.png,The Eastern Orthodox Church acknowledges the
cropped/003c_line_08.png,primacy of honor for the Bishop of Rome but not
cropped/003c_line_09.png,the doctrine of papal supremacy as defined by the
cropped/003c_line_10.png,Catholic Church Orthodox Christians believe that the
cropped/003c_line_11.png,Bishop of Rome was once seen as the first among
cropped/003c_line_12.png,equals but not as a supreme ruler with authority over
cropped/003c_line_13.png,the entire Church The Catholic Church asserts that the
cropped/003c_line_14.png,Pope as successor of Peter holds supreme authority in
cropped/003c_line_15.png,the Church and has the power to make binding decisions
cropped/003c_line_16.png,for the entire Church Orthodox Christians argue that the
cropped/003c_line_17.png,concept of papal supremacy developed later in the
cropped/003c_line_18.png,West and was not part of the early Church's understanding
cropped/003c_line_19.png,of papal authority
cropped/003c_line_21.png,Orthodox Christianity is experiencing growth in absolute
cropped/003c_line_22.png,numbers particularly in Russia and the United States but
cropped/003c_line_23.png,its share of the global Christian population and the
cropped/003c_line_24.png,global population overall is declining After the fall
cropped/003c_line_25.png,of the Soviet Union the Orthodox Church has seen
cropped/003c_line_26.png,a sharp resurgence in Russia with the Orthodox
cropped/003c_line_27.png,Christian population surpassing million Orthodoxy has
cropped/003c_line_28.png,historically grown through adapting its liturgies and
cropped/003c_line_29.png,languages to local cultures
cropped/001c_line_01.png,Predominantly sensors are accumulating data in a constant
cropped/001c_line_02.png,manner which can create large data sets that can be difficult
cropped/001c_line_03.png,to send due to several reasons such as limited
cropped/001c_line_04.png,computational power and bandwidth limitations A solution
cropped/001c_line_05.png,to this includes using compression algorithms to store
cropped/001c_line_06.png,important characteristics of data while reducing storage
cropped/001c_line_07.png,space However this method can be demanding when
cropped/001c_line_08.png,dealing with a drone that has limited amount of
cropped/001c_line_09.png,computation power and limited energy supply from
cropped/001c_line_10.png,a battery
cropped/001c_line_12.png,Dispatching data from a drone to a centralized
cropped/001c_line_13.png,system for storage and processing can cause
cropped/001c_line_14.png,latency and increase traffic if multiple
cropped/001c_line_15.png,sensors sending data Edge computing can prevent
cropped/001c_line_16.png,these issues by allowing computation to
cropped/001c_line_17.png,be closer to the network edge and data
cropped/001c_line_18.png,sources The use of an edge node to
cropped/001c_line_19.png,transfer data and run computational
cropped/001c_line_20.png,algorithms allows for collision avoidance
cropped/001c_line_21.png,of multiple drones allowing them to be
cropped/001c_line_22.png,in operation at the same time and return results
cropped/001c_line_23.png,in real time
cropped/001c_line_25.png,Focusing on the unmanned aerial vehicle the
cropped/001c_line_26.png,collision avoidance problem itself can be formulated
cropped/001c_line_27.png,in two ways as a path planning problem or as a
cropped/001c_line_28.png,collision avoidance maneuvering problem In the first
cropped/001c_line_29.png,case the problem is to plan a feasible path between
cropped/001c_line_30.png,two points while avoiding obstacles while the
cropped/001c_line_31.png,latter addresses the issue of performing avoidance
cropped/001c_line_32.png,maneuvers as obstacles are detected
cropped/002c_line_01.png,Due to an increase in mobile connected devices such
cropped/002c_line_02.png,as smartphones mobile sensors and automobiles the demand
cropped/002c_line_03.png,for a faster and more dependable network is increasing
cropped/002c_line_04.png,Several iterations of mobile networks have been introduced
cropped/002c_line_05.png,starting with first generation mobile networks since then
cropped/002c_line_06.png,many improvements have been made
cropped/002c_line_08.png,In semantic oriented communication the primary emphasis lies
cropped/002c_line_09.png,on the semantic content of the source data rather than the absolute
cropped/002c_line_10.png,accuracy of transmitted bits This approach involves the
cropped/002c_line_11.png,use of a semantic representation module tasked with capturing
cropped/002c_line_12.png,the semantic content from the source data while filtering
cropped/002c_line_13.png,out any superfluous or redundant information before the
cropped/002c_line_14.png,standard data encoding process for transmission Upon
cropped/002c_line_15.png,reception semantic inference and semantic decoding are
cropped/002c_line_16.png,employed to decode the transmitted data typically
cropped/002c_line_17.png,with the assistance of potent AI driven tools
cropped/002c_line_18.png,such as Neural Networks This process results in data
cropped/002c_line_19.png,compression and reduction thereby enhancing transmission
cropped/002c_line_20.png,accuracy and efficiency
cropped/002c_line_22.png,To build an efficient system a model must
cropped/002c_line_23.png,be trained to be able to extract information
cropped/002c_line_24.png,from an image and store it in a smaller
cropped/002c_line_25.png,file This part of the system is classified
cropped/002c_line_26.png,as the encoder for the system to work
cropped/002c_line_27.png,a decoder must be paired with it
cropped/002c_line_28.png,The decoder will be able to make sense
cropped/002c_line_29.png,of the features that have been encoded
cropped/002c_line_30.png,and sent By using this method we
cropped/002c_line_31.png,can reaffirm that the features will not be
cropped/002c_line_32.png,misinterpreted and differ from the class
