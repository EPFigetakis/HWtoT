Due to an increase in mobile connected devices such 
as smartphones mobile sensors and automobiles the demand 
for a faster and more dependable network is increasing 
Several iterations of mobile networks have been introduced 
starting with first generation mobile networks since then 
many improvements have been made

In semantic oriented communication the primary emphasis lies 
on the semantic content of the source data rather than the absolute
accuracy of transmitted bits This approach involves the 
use of a semantic representation module tasked with capturing 
the semantic content from the source data while filtering 
out any superfluous or redundant information before the 
standard data encoding process for transmission Upon 
reception semantic inference and semantic decoding are 
employed to decode the transmitted data typically 
with the assistance of potent AI driven tools 
such as Neural Networks This process results in data 
compression and reduction thereby enhancing transmission 
accuracy and efficiency

To build an efficient system a model must 
be trained to be able to extract information 
from an image and store it in a smaller 
file This part of the system is classified 
as the encoder for the system to work 
a decoder must be paired with it 
The decoder will be able to make sense 
of the features that have been encoded 
and sent By using this method we 
can reaffirm that the features will not be 
misinterpreted and differ from the class
