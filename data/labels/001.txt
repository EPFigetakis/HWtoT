Predominantly sensors are accumulating data in a constant 
manner which can create large data sets that can be difficult
to send due to several reasons such as limited
computational power and bandwidth limitations A solution 
to this includes using compression algorithms to store 
important characteristics of data while reducing storage 
space However this method can be demanding when 
dealing with a drone that has limited amount of 
computation power and limited energy supply from
a battery 

Dispatching data from a drone to a centralized 
system for storage and processing can cause 
latency and increase traffic if multiple 
sensors sending data Edge computing can prevent 
these issues by allowing computation to 
be closer to the network edge and data 
sources The use of an edge node to 
transfer data and run computational 
algorithms allows for collision avoidance 
of multiple drones allowing them to be 
in operation at the same time and return results
in real time

Focusing on the unmanned aerial vehicle the 
collision avoidance problem itself can be formulated 
in two ways as a path planning problem or as a 
collision avoidance maneuvering problem In the first 
case the problem is to plan a feasible path between 
two points while avoiding obstacles while the 
latter addresses the issue of performing avoidance 
maneuvers as obstacles are detected
